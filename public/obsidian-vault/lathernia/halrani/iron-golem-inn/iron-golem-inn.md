Favoured by adventurers, brawlers and those seeking a good time and a cheap and reliable place to stay, the Iron Golem Inn in the west of the Golden Lights District houses a well-renowned fighting ring where people can gamble, watch and participate in gladiatorial combat. It also serves as an import and export for beers, wines and spirits going far and wide, with a mean reputation for its signature Iron Eye whiskey.
