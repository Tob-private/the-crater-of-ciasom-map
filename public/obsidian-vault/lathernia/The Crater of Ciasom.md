## Synopsis 
**The Crater of Ciasom** was formed in a cataclysmic event of legend in the days of old. The apocalyptic event formed a geographical wonder - a circular mountain range that spanned half of the country, its peaks all facing outward from the epicenter of the vast Crater - itself a wasteland of desert and ruins - at which could be found a lake of blood and viscera that oozed aberrant magic within an approximate 50 mile radius, as measured by the Archivists in their forays into the wasteland.
